            🌟 **Welcome to the SCM Practical Repository!**

            Hey there, and welcome aboard! This repository is part of our **Source Code Management (SCM)** practical tasks, where we explore Git, GitHub, and automation with GitHub Actions.

            Here’s a quick intro:
            - 📚 **Purpose**: Learn and demonstrate SCM concepts through hands-on activities like branching, merging, and automation.
            - 🛠️ **Folder Structure**: You'll find experiment-specific files organized by tasks (e.g., `experiment-1`, `experiment-8`, etc.).
            - 🤝 **Collaborate**: Got questions or suggestions? Feel free to open issues or discussions!

            We’re super excited to have you contributing—let’s make learning Git & GitHub fun together! 💻✨
